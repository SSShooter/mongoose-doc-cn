    ## MongoDB Server Version Compatibility

    Mongoose relies on the [MongoDB Node.js Driver](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/)
    to talk to MongoDB. You can refer to
    [this table](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/driver-compatibility-reference/#node-js-driver-compatibility)
    for up-to-date information as to which version of the MongoDB driver
    supports which version of MongoDB.

    Below are the [semver](http://semver.org/) ranges representing which
    versions of mongoose are compatible with the listed versions of MongoDB
    server.

    * MongoDB Server 2.4.x: mongoose `~3.8` or `4.x`
    * MongoDB Server 2.6.x: mongoose `~3.8.8` or `4.x`
    * MongoDB Server 3.0.x: mongoose `~3.8.22`, `4.x` or `5.x`
    * MongoDB Server 3.2.x: mongoose `>=4.3.0` or `5.x`
    * MongoDB Server 3.4.x: mongoose `>=4.7.3` or `5.x`
    * MongoDB Server 3.6.x: mongoose `5.x`, or `>=4.11.0` with `useMongoClient` and `usePushEach`
